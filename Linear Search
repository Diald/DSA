Linear Search- 
linear search is an algorithm which basically iterates through all they elements and compare with key to find a certain element.
here,
1. every element gets compared with the element we need to find 
2. just when the comparison is succesful our search gets completed

Basic Code for Linear Search- 

#driver's code
'''arr=[1,2,45,67,23]
key=45'''
for i in range(0,len(arr)):
    if(key==arr[i]):
        print(i)

complexity analysis of linear search- 

1. the best case scenerio might be that the key was found in the first place, so complexity becomes O(1)

2. the worst case scenerio might be that the element will be found at the end of list
so complexity becomes O(n) 


Diadvantage- linear complexity is a very lengthy process as it have complexity O(n) too 

we can use linear search when we are dealing with small dataset
