Algorithms- 
algorithms is a set of sequence to solve a particular problem.

Characteristics of an algorithm- 
1. clear and unambiguous- each step must be clear and lead to only one meaning 
2. well defined inputs- if an algorithm takes input, it should clearly states which input. an algorithm may or may not take an input. 
3. Well- Defined Outputs- an algorithm should clearly define what output is being given 
4. Finite- it should terminate after a finite period of time 
5. Feasable- it should be executed with the available resources
6. language independent- it must be a plain instructions that can be implemented in any language. 

Properties of an Algorithm- 
1. it should terminate after sometime
2. it should give atleast one output. 
3. it should take zero or one input 
4. it should be deterministic that is giving same input for same input 

TYPES OF ALGORITHMS-

2. Recursive Algorithms 
3. Backtracking Algorithms 
4. Searching Algorithms 
5. Sorting Algorithms 
6. Hashing algorithms 
7. Divide and conquer algorithms 
8. Greedy Algorithm 
9. Dynamic Programming 
10.Randomized algorithm
