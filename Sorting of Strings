Sorting of strings is somewhat different than sorting in lists or arrays. some methods of sorting a string are- 

1. Using sorted(s)

2. using 
s_1= ''.join(sorted(s))
#but this method takes up more memory 

3. by converting first into a list then .sort()
s_1 = list(s)
s.sort()

the best method would be to use sorted(s) since it does not involve more variable declaration.
